From the schematics, we connect the design to a breadboard. The schematic was designed on the Altium designer platform. The ATmega328 uses a 16MHz crystal oscillator, which is key when designing a standalone microcontroller. I connected a push-button on the reset button and added an LED to indicate reset is being performed. I connected the Aref, AVCC, and VCC and added a capacitor between the power supply and ground to reduce noise. A Voltage regulator is essential especially when using an unregulated power supply. I would recommend employing the L7805 linear voltage regulator. 

In matters of code, I have two codes, one for a blink test and the other for a PIR sensor. For the blink test, I connected the LED on pin 6 of the microcontroller, which is pin 4 on the Arduino Uno.
